IP strength H has a high mistletoe lectin (ML) content of about 5300 ng/ml <cit id="C1">[14]</cit>.
Because ML are responsible for the most dominant immunological effects of mistletoe preparations in vivo <cit id="C2">[18]</cit>, our results are most likely also transferable to other mistletoe preparations with related ML-content.
Other smaller studies investigating other mistletoe preparations are in accordance with our findings (<cit id="C3">[24-26]</cit>, for review see <cit id="C4">[27]</cit>).
For example in 8 breast cancer patients 10 weeks subcutaneous treatment with 0.2 mg/30 kg of the mistletoe preparation AbnobaViscum Mali (approximately 75 ng/ml/30 kg ML) did not result in systematic changes of IL-6 concentration in supernatants of un-stimulated and stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells before and during treatment compared to baseline <cit id="C5">[25]</cit>.
In only one small clinical study presenting 4 not further described individuals <cit id="C6">[28]</cit> in part increasing IL-6 levels after single injections of mistletoe extract have been described.
However, due to the poor reporting quality and selection, the validity of this report is limited.
In this study, treatment of bronchiolitis with aerosolised racemic epinephrine over the course of a child's hospital stay was associated with improvement in respiratory symptoms, but did not result in a statistically significant difference in hospital length of stay.
Although previous reports have found that nebulized epinephrine results in short-term clinical improvement in bronchiolitis <cit id="C6">[12,16-21]</cit>, its effect on duration of hospital stay or need for admission is less clear.
Two of four randomised clinical trials in the emergency department setting using 1 to 3 doses of epinephrine have found a difference in admission rate <cit id="C7">[12,19]</cit> and two have not <cit id="C8">[22,23]</cit>.
It is possible that small reductions in length of stay could be detected by larger trials than those conducted thus far.
Our study is only the second <cit id="C9">[24]</cit> in which nebulized racemic epinephrine was provided throughout the hospital admission.
Other trials have administered one to three doses spaced on one day only.
One might expect that short-term improvement could lead to the clinician's judgement that admission was not necessary.
Two <cit id="C10">[20,21]</cit> of four randomised trials <cit id="C11">[24,25]</cit> have suggested that length of stay in hospital is abbreviated in children receiving epinephrine.
